I'm a 3rd year PhD student in Computer Science here at the University of Wisconsin-Madison where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Dimitris Papailiopoulos](http://papail.io/). My research interests are Optimization, Machine Learning, and their extensions to large-scale distributed settings.

Outside of research, I enjoy music, running and reading philosophy. I'm originally from the beautiful city of Bengaluru, India where I was born and raised. I received my B.Tech from National Institute of Technology Karnataka (NITK) and then worked at Adobe Systems for 3 years in Bengaluru before beginning grad school here at UW.

I just recently made this website so it is a little sparse. I intend on adding more things soon!
